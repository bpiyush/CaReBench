## Temporal Antonym Verb-Object Extraction Prompt

---

**TASK:**
Given a pair of sentences describing actions, extract the temporally opposite verbs and the common object they act upon.

**DEFINITION OF TEMPORAL ANTONYMS:**
Two verbs are temporal antonyms if reversing a video of one action would visually resemble the other action. For example:
- "lift" ↔ "lower" (reversing a lift looks like lowering)
- "open" ↔ "close" (reversing an open looks like closing)
- "push" ↔ "pull" (reversing a push looks like pulling)
- "pick" ↔ "drop" (reversing a pick looks like dropping)
- "fold" ↔ "unfold" (reversing a fold looks like unfolding)
- "fill" ↔ "empty" (reversing a fill looks like emptying)

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Read both sentences carefully.
2. Identify the common object mentioned or implied in both sentences.
3. Extract the verb acting on that object in each sentence.
4. Determine if the two verbs are temporal antonyms.
5. Note: Verbs may be implicit (e.g., "walking with a cart" implies "pushing").

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "object": "<common object>",
  "verb_1": "<verb from sentence 1>",
  "verb_2": "<verb from sentence 2>",
  "is_temporal_antonym": true/false,
  "confidence": "high/medium/low",
  "reasoning": "<brief explanation>"
}
```

If no temporal antonym pair is found, return:
```json
{
  "object": null,
  "verb_1": null,
  "verb_2": null,
  "is_temporal_antonym": false,
  "confidence": "high/medium/low",
  "reasoning": "<explanation of why no pair was found>"
}
```

**EXAMPLES:**

Example 1:
Sentence 1: "A man wearing a yellow helmet and a mask is walking around the warehouse with a small cart with cardboard boxes."
Sentence 2: "A man in a yellow helmet is pulling a small cart full of cardboard boxes upside down and greeting the two people next to him."

Output:
```json
{
  "object": "small cart",
  "verb_1": "push",
  "verb_2": "pull",
  "is_temporal_antonym": true,
  "confidence": "medium",
  "reasoning": "Walking with a cart implies pushing it forward. The second sentence explicitly mentions pulling. Push and pull are temporal antonyms."
}
```

Example 2:
Sentence 1: "A woman opens the refrigerator door and looks inside."
Sentence 2: "A woman closes the refrigerator door after taking out a bottle."

Output:
```json
{
  "object": "refrigerator door",
  "verb_1": "open",
  "verb_2": "close",
  "is_temporal_antonym": true,
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasoning": "Open and close are explicit temporal antonyms - reversing a video of opening a door looks like closing it."
}
```

Example 3:
Sentence 1: "A chef picks up a knife from the counter."
Sentence 2: "A chef chops vegetables with a knife."

Output:
```json
{
  "object": "knife",
  "verb_1": "pick",
  "verb_2": "chop",
  "is_temporal_antonym": false,
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasoning": "Pick and chop are not temporal antonyms. Reversing a chopping action does not look like picking up."
}
```

**NOW PROCESS THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE PAIR:**

Sentence 1: "{sentence_1}"
Sentence 2: "{sentence_2}"
